ðŸ§© Repository Pattern (ASP.NET Core)

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern used to separate the data access logic from the business logic in an application.
It acts as a mediator between the domain and data mapping layers, making the code cleaner, more testable, and easier to maintain.

Instead of working directly with Entity Framework Coreâ€™s DbContext in controllers or services, repositories handle all data operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Example:

var products = await _productRepository.GetAllAsync();
await _productRepository.AddAsync(newProduct);


By using the Repository Pattern:

The application follows Separation of Concerns (SoC).

Business logic is independent of the database implementation.

Unit testing becomes simpler since repositories can be easily mocked.
